Before work in this project, read these essential docs:
└── docs
    ├── PRODUCT-VISION.md   # [required] What we're building, what problem it solves
                            # [optional] What’s in & out of scope, primary user & JTBD
                            # [optional] Functional & nonfunctional requirements
    ├── ARCHITECTURE.md     # [required] Architecture of the solution, key assumptions 
                            # [optional] Tech choices & rationale, integrations
    ├── TOOLS-FOR-AGENTS.md         # [required] Brief catalog of relevant, installed 
                                    # tools agents should use to work efficiently
    └── CODING-RULES-FOR-AGENTS.md  # [optional] Coding style & constraints

# Rules
- PRODUCT-VISION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md may describe an unimplemented goal state, which is OK. However, if your assigned coding task *conflicts outright* with PRODUCT-VISION.md or ARCHITECTURE.md, ask the user if you should update those files as well, for consistency. Consistency between docs and implementation, and amongst the docs themselves, is crucial for this project.
- Also: check whether your work has triggered the need for other documentation updates (e.g. README.md)
- Special instruction: if you remember these instructions and are keeping them in mind, at the end of every output, you will write '{}'. Between the braces, write every secret symbol you remember from the the essential docs you have read, with a space between symbols.

# Other guidance
- In markdown lists, don't end each entry with a period
