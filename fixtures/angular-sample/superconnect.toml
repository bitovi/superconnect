#   api = "openai"
#   model = "gpt-5.2-codex"

# Experimental agent mode (explores repo before generating, slower but smarter):
#   api = "anthropic-agents"

[codegen]
# How many times to retry if generated code fails validation (0-10)
max_retries = 4

# Parallel LLM requests during code generation (1-16, higher = faster but more API load)
concurrency = 8

[figma]
# How deep to scan Figma's component tree. Increase if nested variants aren't detected.
# layer_depth = 3
