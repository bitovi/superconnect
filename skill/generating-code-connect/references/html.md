# HTML and Angular Code Connect reference

## What to read
- https://developers.figma.com/docs/code-connect/html/
- Focus on figma.connect, props mapping, example, variants, children, and text mapping

## Quick rules to enforce
- figma.connect uses an object literal
- example uses only props defined in props
- Use figma.children for slots and figma.textContent for text layers
- Keep templates valid and minimal
